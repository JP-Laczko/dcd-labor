                  We get it, "hourly landscaping" doesn't always have the best reputation. People assume they'll end up with slow, unmotivated workers just burning time. But at DCD, that couldn't be further from the truth.
                </p>
              </div>

                <div className="paragraph-icon">üè°</div>
                <p>
                  When you choose DCD's hourly service, you're hiring a crew of hardworking, trustworthy young men who were raised right here in the community and care about doing the job well, and fast. We operate with a community-first mindset that values hustle, honesty, and high standards.
                </p>
              </div>

                <p>
                  In most cases, our clients pay much less with the hourly rate. That's because our crews don't waste time, we get in, get it done, and leave your yard looking better than ever. More importantly, we operate with a certification on our work, which is that we will come back and fix any mistake or missed spot for free.
                </p>

                  And by booking directly online and choosing hourly, you help us skip the back-and-forth quoting process, so we can spend more time doing what we love: serving the great people of this community with the lowest rates and the highest quality work around.
