Flip the our story and book a service section

The logos in the follow up section don’t match at all. It should be Facebook, then instagram, then TikTok. 

The grey text in schedule your service today… in the home page still isn’t readable - make it white or a shade of gray.

Right under the head, the first thing I want to have is a calendar section where each day has a little box that you can click on to schedule a service. This will be dynamic and show red or green based on if that day is available or not - we will pull from the backend to check this. Clicking on an available day will take you right to the Book service section and fill out that day on the form. 

How should we handle the scheduling? I’m going to use MongoDB as the backend to store the available times. Should we store it as the upcoming 2 weeks and available hours? Then display this in the book a service?
